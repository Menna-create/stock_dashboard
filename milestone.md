# Project Milestones Report

## Overview
This document outlines the key milestones achieved in developing a financial data dashboard using AI-assisted development.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Basic Backend

### Accomplishment
Successfully set up the Elixir/Phoenix backend environment and created the first API endpoint that could connect to Finnhub and fetch basic stock data.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Didn't know how to install Elixir/Phoenix  
  **Solution:** Used opto-gpt to generate step-by-step installation commands
- **Challenge:** API connection errors  
  **Solution:** Aider helped debug authentication issues by analyzing Finnhub's documentation
- **Challenge:** Confusion about Phoenix project structure  
  **Solution:** Generated visual diagrams of the architecture using opto-gpt prompts

### AI Utilization
- opto-gpt created the exact commands to initialize a new Phoenix project
- Aider helped modify the default router.ex file to add our first endpoint
- Combined AI models suggested the optimal project structure

### Lessons Learned
1. AI can effectively guide complete beginners through complex setup processes
2. It's crucial to verify AI-generated commands before execution
3. Creating small, testable components first leads to faster debugging

## Milestone 2: Frontend Integration with Svelte

### Accomplishment
Implemented a functional Svelte frontend that could display stock data fetched from our Phoenix backend.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** No knowledge of Svelte components  
  **Solution:** Used Aider to generate template components
- **Challenge:** CORS issues between frontend/backend  
  **Solution:** opto-gpt provided the precise Phoenix CORS configuration
- **Challenge:** State management confusion  
  **Solution:** AI created a simple data store pattern

### AI Utilization
- opto-gpt generated the prompts that were then fed to Aider to create components
- Used Aider's chat interface to iteratively improve the UI
- Both tools collaborated to solve the data fetching implementation

### Lessons Learned
1. Frontend-backend communication requires explicit configuration
2. AI can accelerate UI development but needs clear design specifications
3. Component-based architecture makes features easier to modify

## Milestone 3: Advanced Financial Data Features

### Accomplishment
Added sophisticated financial functionality including historical data charts and real-time price updates.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Complex time-series data formatting  
  **Solution:** Aider helped transform API responses
- **Challenge:** Websocket implementation hurdles  
  **Solution:** opto-gpt provided Phoenix channel examples
- **Challenge:** Performance issues  
  **Solution:** AI suggested optimization strategies

### AI Utilization
- opto-gpt analyzed Finnhub docs to create implementation prompts
- Aider wrote the Elixir code to process candle stick data
- Used both tools in tandem to debug real-time issues

### Lessons Learned
1. Financial data requires careful normalization
2. Real-time features introduce new architectural considerations
3. API documentation often needs interpretation that AI can assist with

## Milestone 4: Deployment and Optimization

### Accomplishment
Successfully deployed the complete application to a production environment.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Deployment configuration confusion  
  **Solution:** AI generated step-by-step deployment checklist
- **Challenge:** Database performance issues  
  **Solution:** opto-gpt suggested indexing strategies
- **Challenge:** Environment variable management  
  **Solution:** Aider helped implement secure configuration

### AI Utilization
- opto-gpt created comparison of deployment options
- Aider wrote the necessary GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Both tools helped troubleshoot production-specific bugs

### Lessons Learned
1. Production environments reveal new issues
2. Security considerations become paramount
3. Monitoring is crucial for performance optimization

## General Observations

### Model Selection Strategy
- Used opto-gpt for architecture decisions
- Relied on Aider for direct code implementation
- Switched models based on problem type

### Effective Prompting
- Learned to provide context about our knowledge level
- Found success with "explain like I'm new" approaches
- Breaking problems into small units yielded better results

### Verification Process
- Established routine of testing in isolated environments
- Learned to cross-reference multiple AI outputs
- Developed validation checklists for generated code
